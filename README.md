# Insurance & Life Expectancy Estimation

## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to model and predict life expectancy / insurance-related outcomes using structured tabular data.

The objective is to demonstrate regression modeling, feature analysis, and evaluation techniques in a real-world predictive setting.

## Problem Statement

Insurance pricing and life expectancy estimation rely on statistical modeling of demographic and risk-related variables.

This project explores:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature engineering and transformation  
- Training regression models  
- Evaluating predictive performance

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values  
- Removed inconsistencies  
- Encoded categorical variables where necessary  

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Selected relevant predictors  
- Applied scaling / normalization (if applicable)  

### 3. Model Training
- Linear Regression  
- (Add other models used: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R² Score  
- Residual analysis
